# Asynchronous Web Crawler

This **asynchronous web crawler** is built with Python using **asyncio** and **aiohttp** to enable high-performance, concurrent web scraping. It efficiently fetches web pages, extracts links for further crawling, and stores the scraped data (URLs and text content) in a CSV file. Designed for scalability, it provides configurable limits on concurrency, crawl depth, and error handling to ensure smooth and efficient operation itâ€™s perfect for data collection, research, web exploration or building datasets to create your own custom GPT model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- aiohttp
- aiofiles
- beautifulsoup4
- tldextract

## Installation


1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Roozbeho/FastWebCrawler.git

 cd web-crawler
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

```bash
 python main.py https://example.com --crawl-count 50
```

| `urls`                  | Starting URLs             | Required             |
| `-f, --file`            | File containing seed URLs | None                 |
| `-d, --domain`          | Target domain filter      | None                 |
| `-sd, --subdomain`      | Target subdomain filter   | None                 |
| `-c, --crawl-count`     | Max URLs to crawl         | 20                   |
| `-r, --retries`         | Request retry attempts    | 5                    |
| `-mc, --max-connection` | Concurrent connections    | 10                   |
| `-t, --timeout`         | Request timeout (seconds) | 1                    |
| `--output-file`         | Output CSV path           | data/scrape_data.csv |
| `--log-level`           | Log verbosity             | INFO                 |


## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - The crawler starts with a list of URLs, optional domain/subdomain filters, and settings for crawl count, concurrency, retries, and timeouts.

2. **URL Filtering**:
   - URLs are validated and filtered to exclude unwanted types (e.g., `.jpg`, `.mp3`) and paths (e.g., `/login/`, `/admin/`).

3. **Asynchronous Crawling**:
   - Uses `asyncio` and a semaphore to limit concurrent requests based on the `max_connection` setting.
   - Fetches HTML content, extracts links, and processes text concurrently.

4. **Text Extraction**:
   - Parses HTML with `BeautifulSoup` to extract readable text, stripping out scripts, styles, and metadata.

5. **Output**:
   - Writes each URL and its extracted text to a CSV file, ensuring thread-safe file access with a lock.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Retries failed requests up to the specified limit and logs errors (e.g., timeouts, network issues).
